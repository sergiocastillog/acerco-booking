# Timerise open source booking page

We are pleased to provide our booking page in open-source. We hope it will be useful in your use case. It can be embedded on websites and applications, under buttons, and in popups - on desktop and mobile. Happy booking!

Timerise open source booking page was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

Run following script in the root directory:

```
npm ci
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Developer mode is by default connected to the sandbox environment. If you want to connect to a different environment during development please edit `.env.development` file in the root folder.

To open the service page on localhost use link [http://localhost:3000/service/{replace-with-service-id}](http://localhost:3000/service/{replace-with-service-id})

To make your life easier we prepared a default service on the sandbox environment which you can use for testing [http://localhost:3000/service/E95rBw4j9Thhts2vzY1Y](http://localhost:3000/service/E95rBw4j9Thhts2vzY1Y).

We encourage you to create your own services on the sandbox environment via [user interface](https://sandbox.timerise.io/) or [api](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/TIMERISE-API/explorer?variant=sandbox). Of course you can do it for free.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Please remember that build command requires `.env` file in root directory.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
